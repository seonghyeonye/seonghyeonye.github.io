Hello, I am a B.S student in KAIST School of Computing.

My research interests are natural language processing, big data analysis, and deep learning.

I am currently an undergraduate research intern in <a href="https://uilab.kaist.ac.kr/">U&I Lab</a> in KAIST, School of Computing. I am advised by Professor <a href="https://aliceoh9.github.io/">Alice Oh</a> for now.
